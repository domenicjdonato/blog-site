# Quadratic Approximation of the Posterior -- Deep Dive

In this article, we go over how to find:
the maximum a posteriori (MAP) of a Gaussian model with priors
the marginal distribution of each parameter via Quadratic Approximation

This is called a Quadratic Approximation "deep dive" because we're going to go through steps in as much detail as possible: Taylor Expansion, Covariance Matrix, Σ, and it's inverse Σ⁻1
(aka Laplace Approximation) to
